## Description
This program was made for my final project for my databases project, and was also developed to be a useful tool for meal planning for my fraternity. It can be used to automatically generate a menu and shopping list.

## How to use
To use, run main.py. You will need to have menu.sql in the same folder. You may need to download Python and SQLite.

## To-Do
- Currently, the program remakes the database every time its run, causing changes to not be saved. This was done for testing purposes, and I intend to change it eventually.
- I want to add more options, such as being able to generate a single item
- I want to look at exporting the menu and shopping list into a printable file format
